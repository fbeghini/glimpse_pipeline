Command output:

  sbatch: error: in the future, please use job arrays to submit large numbers of jobs instead.
  sbatch: error: For more information: https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/common-job-failures/#rate-limits

Tip: you can try to figure out what's wrong by changing to the process work dir and showing the script file named `.command.sh`
